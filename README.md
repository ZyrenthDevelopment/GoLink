# GoLink
GoLink is another side-project by Zyrenth. It's a simple private link shortener, it has an admin panel that looks like it was made in 2010 and it shortens links I guess?

# Database setup
Install [SurrealDB](https://surrealdb.com) on your machine since this is the database this project is using.

After that make sure it's in the path and if yes you should be able to run the database with the following command:
```bash
npm run database
```

# Project setup
Install the required packages using the following command:
```bash
npm i
```

After that build the project with the following command:
```bash
npm run build
```

If it's successfully finished building you can go ahead and run the project with this command:
```bash
npm run start
```
